# Discrete mathematics

This is the dedicated storage space for maths-related notes, exercise answers and more. I’m using GitHub rather than GitLab because the latter imposes a limit on the number of mathematical expressions that can be rendered in LaTeX (exactly 50).

**Important to note** is that I’ve installed [xhub](https://github.com/nschloe/xhub#latex) on my browsers, to be better able to render mathematical expressions. This decision is largely influenced by this [blog post](https://nschloe.github.io/2022/05/20/math-on-github.html) which recommends xhub. Inline maths statements should be introduced with the following syntax:

```
`$…$`
```

To trigger GitHub’s **online IDE**, replace `github.com/*` with `github.`**`dev`**`/*` and the online editor will load.
